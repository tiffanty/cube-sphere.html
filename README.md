üåê 3D Hello World ‚Äì Three.js Web Visualization
This project is a beginner-friendly interactive 3D scene built with HTML, JavaScript, and Three.js. It showcases fundamental concepts in 3D graphics, including scene setup, object creation, lighting, camera manipulation, and animation.

‚ú® Features
Rotating Sphere and Cube using real-time animation loops

Directional and Point Lighting for dynamic shading and depth

OrbitControls for user-controlled camera movement

Hierarchical Object Grouping via invisible pivot points for composite animation

Responsive rendering using WebGLRenderer and full-screen canvas

üß† Skills Demonstrated
DOM integration of WebGL-rendered canvas

Use of external JS libraries (Three.js, OrbitControls)

Basic 3D geometry creation, material application, and transformation

Animation loop logic and object rotation

Scene composition and interactive control design

üöÄ Getting Started
